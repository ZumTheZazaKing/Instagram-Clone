an Instagram I coded using pure Vanilla CSS and JavaScript. Of course with HTML as well

the post that I used for this Instagram Clone originally belongs to progammer.me from Instagram

Shoutout to programmer.me!

Anyway, this took me quite the adequate amount of time and tried my best to really make it the same as the Instagram's UI

But I don't know if it'll be the same with other users becuase I'm using a Mac and the UI might be different for Windows Users

Either way, I tried my best to intimidate Instagram's Apple UI. I even made it mobile-compatible so when you shrink the screen it'll look like the UI on mobile.

So yeah, if you want to use the code, please credit me

If you want to review the code and tell me about a few improvements I can perform, please do so
